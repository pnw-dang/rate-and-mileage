# rate-and-mileage
This project was a way for me to practice using polymorphism. The layout is similar to my [Car Price and Total project](https://github.com/teddy-ui/car-price-and-total), but itâ€™s more dependent on user interaction. I learned a lot about working with lists, and had lots of fun figuring out how to display the information to both ListViews!

**How to Use**

To change the rate or mileage, you must click on a customer then choose one of their vehicles to modify. Input whatever number you want into the corresponding textbox then click update to see the changes.
